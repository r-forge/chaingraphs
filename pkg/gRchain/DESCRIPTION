Description:  Fits (block recursive) chain graph models. The package contains various functions, wrappers, methods and classes for fitting, plotting and displaying different chain graph models. Currently the Cox Wermuth (1996) strategy is implemented based on the description in Caputo et al. (1997) together with some liberal interpretations of details by the package authors. Traceable regressions will follow.
